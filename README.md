# nyaa3
Next version of nyaa, built on Nim.

# Why?
Speed, code readability and efficiency get harder and harder on shell and i consider nyaa2 to be a complete project.

# Compatibility
nyaa3 will be compatible with nyaa2, through a script.

# Building and installation
You can build through `nimble`.
Run `nimble build` to build, and `nimble install` to install.
