# nyaa3
Next version of nyaa, built on Nim.

# Why?
Speed, code readability and efficiency get harder and harder on shell and i consider nyaa2 to be a complete project.

# Compatibility
nyaa3 will be compatible with nyaa2, through a script.

# Building and installation
You can build through `nimble`.
We recommend using the ssl task to build since repositories that nyaa3 is configured with need SSL.
Run `nimble ssl` to build, and `nimble install` to install.
